# Topic Modelling with Gensim Package: Project Overview

The model was created to determine the number of topic based on a procurement dataset, which was obtained from Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/nikhil1011/product-category-from-invoice/data)

## Topic Modelling - Why?
 
In the current digital powered world, the creation and consumption of data are constantly growing exponentially. In 2020, an average of 1.7MB of data is created by a person every second or 2.5 quintillion bytes per day. On average, 95% of businesses faces unstructured data as an issue for their digital operations. It can be difficult and costly to manage, run analysis and search insights with data coming in unconnected forms, sizes, shapes, and meaning. Topic modelling was developed as a text data mining tool to comprehend, organise, discover and connect the endless amount of text data. 

## Topic Modelling - What?

Topic modelling refers to the technique of the algorithm to discover huge volume of data generated in low dimension and to uncover hidden concepts, prominent features or latent variables of data, depending on the application of concept. Examples of real-world data includes social media feeds, product customer reviews, user feedbacks, tweets, e-mails, spams, and customer complaints. Initially - through the algebraic perspective, dimension reduction can be seen to decomponse the original matrix into factor matrix. Hence, the typical classification strategy can be described as probablistic models and non-probabilistic models [1].
